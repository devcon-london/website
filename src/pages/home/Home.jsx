    <h4>Q: What is Devcon.London?</h4>
    <p>A: Devcon.London is an invitation-only community of developers.</p>
    <h4>Q: How do I get in?</h4>
    <p>A: You should know someone who is already in and willing to invite you.</p>
    <h4>Q: Why is this community so private?</h4>
    <p>
      A: Because we believe that keeping strong relationships between our members is healthy
      and granting access on an invite-basis is a way of doing so. Also, we can guarantee privacy
      for our members and avoid unsolicited contacts from people who are not interested in the community.
    </p>
    <h4>Q: OK, I have an invite, how do I get in now?</h4>
    <p>
      A: Login using your Github account, then head to the subscribe page and fill the form.
      One of the admins will review your submission and let you in.
